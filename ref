Redis
https://redis.io/

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, 
cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, 
sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries 
and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and 
different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and
automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
